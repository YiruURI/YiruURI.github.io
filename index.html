        <p class="c6"><span>California Senate Bill 960 (</span><span class="c1"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id%3D202120220SB960&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1673617444217003&amp;usg=AOvVaw3ULP_mhFpKdFoDOwMCnq5B">SB
                    960</a></span><span class="c3">) was recently passed by the California State Senate and signed into
                law
                by the Governor. This bill made several significant changes to the requirements for police officers,
                also
                known as &ldquo;peace officers,&rdquo; in the state of California, including the removal of citizenship
                requirements for police officers in the state.</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span class="c3">Under the previous law, peace officers in California were required to either be a
                citizen of the United States or a permanent resident who was eligible for and had applied for
                citizenship.
                SB 960 removes this requirement and instead requires peace officers to be legally authorized to work in
                the
                United States, consistent with federal law and regulations. This change brings California in line with
                federal law, which allows certain non-citizens to work in the United States with the proper
                documentation.</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span>According to supporters, the purpose of the new law is to bring greater diversity to the
                police
                force of California, as well as to remove a major barrier that prevented otherwise qualified individuals
                from becoming police officers. &ldquo;Effective policing requires peace officers who are part of the
                communities they police,&rdquo; </span><span class="c1"><a class="c4"

                    the California Public Defenders Association in support of the bill.</a></span><span>&nbsp;&ldquo;It
                is
                also important that members of law enforcement reflect the diverse communities they serve,&rdquo; the
                association continues.</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span>There has been some controversy surrounding the bill, notably from right-wing viewpoints who

                clarification
                from supporters reveals that although the language in the bill does not explicitly address illegal
                immigrants, the bill requires police officers to be </span><span class="c1"><a class="c4"

                    Safety Video Briefing: SB 960 Eliminates Citizenship Requirement for Peace Officers</a></small></p>
        <p class="c6"><span class="c3">A related change made by SB 960 is the removal of the prohibition on appointing
                non-citizens as members of the California Highway Patrol. This agency, which is part of the
                Transportation
                Agency and responsible for enforcing traffic laws and maintaining public safety on California&#39;s
                highways, had previously only been allowed to appoint citizens as members. With the passage of SB 960,
                the
                California Highway Patrol will now be able to consider non-citizens for appointment as well.</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span>Opponents of the bill have raised concerns about the potential impact on public safety and
                the
                integrity of the peace officer profession. They argue that the citizenship requirement was put in place
                for
                good reason that police officers should be allegiance to the United States and the Constitution, and
                that
                removing it could potentially expose the state to security risks. &nbsp;&ldquo;According to the Peace
                Officers&rsquo; Research Association of California, &lsquo;Although we understand the author&rsquo;s
                intent
                with the bill, we have serious concerns that if SB 960 became law, non-United States citizens, who
                become
                peace officers, would have access to highly confidential information,&rsquo; &rdquo; </span><span
                class="c1"><a class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billAnalysisClient.xhtml?bill_id%3D202120220SB960&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1673617444219190&amp;usg=AOvVaw3lwH8VTmfqdp8EPfbBiJP3">noted
                    the Senate Third Reading of the bill</a></span><span class="c3">.</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span>In addition to changing the citizenship requirement for peace officers, SB 960 also made
                changes
                to the accreditation standards for the education that peace officers must have. Previously, the minimum
                education requirement for peace officers was a high school diploma or the equivalent, and accreditation
                for
                educational institutions had to come from certain recognized agencies or organizations. SB 960 expands
                the
                recognized accrediting organizations to include Cognia, a non-profit organization that focuses on
                improving
                schools and education systems around the world. &ldquo;This bill would revise the accreditation
                standards to
                include an organization holding full membership in Cognia,&rdquo; stated the </span><span class="c1"><a
                    class="c4"
                    href="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billTextClient.xhtml?bill_id%3D202120220SB960&amp;sa=D&amp;source=editors&amp;ust=1673617444219592&amp;usg=AOvVaw3BB-cKztfgv6YhmB_e_TeV">text</a></span><span class="c3"> of the bill.</span></p>
        <p class="c6"><span class="c3">Overall, the passage of SB 960 represents a significant shift in the requirements
                and
                standards for peace officers in California. By removing the requirement that police officers be either a
                citizen of the United States or a permanent resident who is eligible for and has applied for
                citizenship,
                the bill significantly expands the pool of candidates for police officer positions, which may open up
                the
                possibility of more individuals being able to apply. This could potentially lead to a larger pool of
                qualified candidates to choose from, which could be particularly beneficial in areas where there are
                shortages of law enforcement personnel. In addition, by removing the citizenship requirement, the bill
                may
                allow more individuals from diverse backgrounds, such as non-citizens, to become police officers. This
                could
                potentially lead to a more diverse law enforcement workforce that better reflects the communities it
                serves.
                While the bill has its supporters and detractors, it remains to be seen how these changes will impact
                the
                state&rsquo;s law enforcement agencies and their respective communities.</span></p>
